                <h2>Methodist Boys' High School (Sierra Leone)</h2>
                <p>The Methodist Boys' High School in Freetown, Sierra Leone, is one of the oldest secondary schools for boys in the country. It has produced, over the years, countless alumni in many walks of life. If you do a search in the present government infrastructure in Sierra Leone you will find a lot of its alumni especially in civil service, secondary and tertiary education. It is a very old school with tentacles deep
                    in the country. Just imagine: It was established in 1874, at a time when Sierra Leone was a full-blown Crown colony and its graduates among the first teachers in Sierra Leone and the rest of the then British-colonized West Africa namely, Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria. Some went to neighbouring Liberia and became top civil servants, teachers and university administrators.</p>
                    <p>MBHS, like other prominent Sierra Leonean schools, has alumni associations in many parts of the world including Europe and North America and one of such chapters is the Texas chapter. This chapter is one of the most vibrant and active in the world. They are focused on rebuilding and rehabilitating the school in diverse ways.

            On March 2021, work began to install air conditioners in the Dr. Arouna Davies and Taylor-Cummings Resource Center to provide a more conducive learning environment for the students and teachers.

        <p>From July 2018 thru September 2019, members of the association challenged themselves to bring back the school Library. The school had lost its Library due to dilapidation; the building became inhabitable and was shut down for over five years.
            Association members approached the re-building process on a project-by-project basis. They replaced the roof, ceiling and windows, overhauled the building's foundation, painted the entire building with glossy oil paint both interior and exterior, installed new furniture and fittings, installed solar and government run electricity grid, a back-up generator, shelved thousands of new and gently used textbooks.</p>
